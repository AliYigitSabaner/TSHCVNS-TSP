# TSHCVNS-TSP
Hybrid Tabu Search, Hill Climbing, and Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm for TSP

This repository contains the source code of the TS-HC-VNS algorithm proposed in our research for solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The method integrates three well-known metaheuristic strategies — Tabu Search (TS), Hill Climbing (HC), and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) — to form a robust hybrid algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization.

-Abstract

The TS-HC-VNS algorithm is a hybrid metaheuristic that effectively balances intensification and diversification by dynamically combining the memory-based exploration of Tabu Search, the fast local search of Hill Climbing, and the adaptive neighborhood changes of VNS. The algorithm has been tested on 30 symmetric TSPLIB benchmark instances 

Symmetric travelling salesman problems are solved in TSPLIB library. In order for the code to work, it is enough to have the data files with .tsp extension and TS_HC_VNS_TSP_Code.py python code in the same folder. Implemented on Pycharm.
